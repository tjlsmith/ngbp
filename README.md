My Nuts Good Battleship Program Android app. A work in progress 

This is my first attempt at a commercial Android game and the GAME is good - it even computes an ELO score - but the rest blows.

First problem is the 3 second delay from the opening screen to the game runs whether you hit the opening screen or not.

I also cannot get it to delay a second before responding to your move (even though it computes the response instantly)

It goes on and on, it's totally not ready for prime time.

BUT - it DOES play Nuts Good Battleship and if you win 1 time in 3 you're doing well...

I need to be pointed in the right direction to learn the stuff I need to fix this.
